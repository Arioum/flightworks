# FlightWorks - Check flight status
### Flightworks allows users to search for airports and view details like airport details, arrivals and departures index in real time.

<br/>

### Status : 
Work in progress

<br/>

### TechStack:
[![html, css, tailwind, js, remix](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=html,css,tailwind,js,remix)]()

### Tools used:
[![vscode, postman, vercel](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=vscode,postman,vercel)]()

<br/>

### What it does :

* Allows users to search for airport by its IATA code.
* If the airport is found, details like contact and other info such as address and view in map are displayed.
* Users can choose to view more info about the airport here like airport status and current arrivals and departure index.
* Detailed info such as airport's ariel imagery, weather conditions, popular routes, runway lengths are displayed.
* Airport arrival and departures are also subsequently displayed, which contains scheduled time, estimated time, airline name, destination or origin etc.

### Future Scope : 
Introduce a backend to limit functionalities for the users, as the API being used here has a hard limit on the amount of requests that we can send per month.
